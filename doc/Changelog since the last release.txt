Bug fix :
	- Disable the context menu on the toolbar

	- System Tray Icon
	- Global HotKey 'Print Screen' to take a screenshot
	
Improvement :

		- Don't ask the directory, just always use the default directory
		- Don't show the draw window, in the single screenshot mode
	- 2 modes : Single screenshot & Multiple screenshots
	- Draw tool, to paint on screenshot
		- Possibility to change the color of the tool
		- Delete tool
		- Pen tool
		- Line tool
		- Rectangle tool
